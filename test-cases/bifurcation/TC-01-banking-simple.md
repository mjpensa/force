# Mobile Banking App Redesign Initiative

## Project Overview

Our retail banking division is planning a complete redesign of the mobile banking application to improve customer satisfaction scores and reduce support call volume.

## Current State

The existing mobile app has a 3.2-star rating on app stores with 47,000 reviews. Primary complaints include slow transaction processing (average 8-12 seconds per action) and confusing navigation requiring average of 4.7 taps to complete common tasks.

## Objectives

1. Improve app store rating to 4.5+ stars
2. Reduce transaction processing time to under 3 seconds
3. Simplify navigation to maximum 2 taps for common tasks
4. Decrease support calls related to mobile app by 60%

## Timeline

- Q1 2026: Design phase and user research
- Q2 2026: Development and internal testing
- Q3 2026: Beta testing with 5,000 customers
- Q4 2026: Full rollout to 2.3 million customers

## Budget

Estimated total investment: $1.8 million over 12 months

## Competitive Context

Chase Mobile recently launched a redesigned app with 4.6-star rating. Bank of America's app processes transactions in under 2 seconds. Wells Fargo's app has best-in-class navigation requiring only 1.8 average taps for common tasks.

## Success Metrics

- App store rating: Target 4.5+ (current 3.2)
- Transaction speed: Target <3 seconds (current 8-12 seconds)
- Navigation efficiency: Target <2 taps (current 4.7 taps)
- Support call reduction: Target 60% (baseline: 18,000 calls/month)
- Customer retention: Prevent projected 12% annual churn
