## Sample Content (File 1 - Executive Summary)

### Core Banking System Modernization Initiative

Our current core banking system, IBM z/OS mainframe running software from 1998, processes 12.4 million transactions daily for 3.2 million customer accounts. System limitations are preventing digital innovation and costing $8.7 million annually in maintenance.

**Strategic Drivers:**
- Cannot support real-time payments or modern API integrations
- 18-24 month timeline to launch new products (vs. 2-3 months for digital-first banks)
- Operating on unsupported software versions, regulatory compliance risk
- Technical talent shortage: Only 147 COBOL programmers under age 30 in US

**Modernization Approach:**
Replace legacy core with cloud-native platform (Temenos, Thought Machine, or Mambu). Phased migration over 24 months to minimize disruption to 3.2 million customers.

**Investment:**
- Software licenses and implementation: $28 million
- Cloud infrastructure (5-year): $11 million
- Data migration and testing: $6 million
- Change management and training: $2 million
- **Total: $47 million**

**Expected Benefits:**
- Time to market for new products: 24 months → 3 months (88% reduction)
- Operational cost reduction: $8.7M → $3.2M annually (63% reduction)
- Real-time payment capability: Enable instant ACH, Zelle, RTP
- API-first architecture: Enable fintech partnerships and open banking

**Competitive Context:**
- Ally Bank migrated to cloud-native core in 2024, reducing costs 71%
- Marcus by Goldman Sachs built on Thought Machine from inception, launches products in weeks
- 34% of US regional banks still running core banking systems from pre-2000

**Timeline:**
- Q1-Q2 2026: Vendor selection and contract negotiation
- Q3 2026-Q1 2027: Non-customer-facing systems migration (reporting, analytics)
- Q2-Q4 2027: Customer account migration in 3 phases
- Q1 2028: Legacy system decommissioning

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Zero customer-facing downtime during migration
- Maintain regulatory compliance throughout transition
- Preserve all 40 years of historical transaction data
- Achieve >95% first-time data migration accuracy
