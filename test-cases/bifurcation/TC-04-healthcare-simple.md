Regional healthcare network plans to expand telemedicine services from current 8,000 monthly virtual visits to 35,000 monthly visits by end of 2026.

## Current State

Platform: Teladoc integration serving 142,000 covered members
Current utilization: 5.6% of members use telemedicine monthly

## Market Drivers

McKinsey Health Institute 2025 report shows telemedicine adoption stabilized at 38% of all medical consultations post-pandemic, up from 11% pre-2020. Rural area adoption rate: 47% (vs. 34% urban).

Competing health systems:
- Kaiser Permanente: 52% of consultations now via telemedicine

4. Reduce wait time to <10 minutes (industry leading)
5. Add multilingual support (Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese)
