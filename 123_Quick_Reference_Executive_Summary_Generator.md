## SAMPLE OUTPUT CHECK

Your executive summary succeeds if:
- A CEO would clear their calendar to read it
- A board would fund initiatives based on it
- A competitor would worry after reading it
- A journalist would quote from it
- An analyst would cite it in research

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

❌ Generic corporate speak without specific data
❌ Technical jargon without business impact
❌ Linear description without dramatic tension
❌ Round numbers instead of precise figures
❌ Passive voice instead of active declarations
❌ Abstract concepts without concrete examples
❌ Even-handed analysis without clear winners/losers
❌ Conclusions without actionable imperatives

## THE ULTIMATE TEST

Read your executive summary aloud. If it doesn't sound like the opening to a business thriller that happens to be true, revise until it does.

Remember: You're not writing a report—you're crafting a strategic wake-up call.
