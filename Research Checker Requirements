Of course. Based on a thorough analysis of the application's codebase, here is a detailed description of its functionality and purpose.
Project Purpose
The "Cross-LLM Research Synthesis" application is a sophisticated tool designed to address a critical challenge in the age of artificial intelligence: the inconsistency and lack of verifiable provenance in AI-generated research. Its primary purpose is to ingest research outputs from multiple, diverse Large Language Models (LLMs), automatically analyze them for consensus and contradictions, and synthesize the findings into a single, cohesive, and rigorously cited report.
This application acts as an automated research analyst and fact-checker, creating a final document that is more reliable and transparent than the output of any single LLM by enforcing strict provenance rules at every step.
Core Functionality & Key Features
The application is architected as a multi-stage, "best-of-each" pipeline, where each step performs a specialized task. Users can run the entire pipeline automatically or execute each step individually.
1. Multi-Source Ingestion & Processing
Flexible Input: Users can upload multiple source documents in common formats, including PDF, DOCX, and Markdown.
Source Attribution: Each uploaded file is assigned to a specific LLM provider (e.g., GEMINI, GPT, CLAUDE, GROK) to track the origin of the information.
Robust Parsing: The application intelligently parses the content of these files, converting them into raw text ready for analysis.
2. The Synthesis Pipeline
The core of the application is an 8-step automated workflow:
Step 1: Claim Extraction: Using a powerful Gemini model, the application reads each source text and meticulously extracts every "atomic claim"—a single, verifiable statement of fact. This deconstructs dense paragraphs into a structured list of individual data points.
Step 2: Ledger Merging & Visualization: All claims from all sources are aggregated into a single "claim ledger." The application provides immediate visual feedback with bar charts that break down the number of claims by both LLM provider and topic, offering a high-level view of the source data.
Step 3: Contradiction Detection: The unified ledger is analyzed by the Gemini API to identify and classify discrepancies. The system intelligently detects various types of conflicts, such as:
Numerical Conflicts: Disagreements on numbers, dates, or statistics.
Polarity Differences: Opposing conclusions (e.g., positive vs. negative).
Definitional Nuances: Subtle differences in the meaning of key terms.
Temporal Shifts: One source presenting outdated information superseded by another.
Step 4: Report Synthesis: The application generates a comprehensive research report in Markdown format. This report is highly structured, including:
An Executive Summary.
A breakdown of findings by topic, clearly separating points of Consensus from areas of Disagreement.
A list of identified Evidence Gaps (claims with no citation).
A complete Sources Appendix.
Step 5: Provenance Auditing: To ensure integrity, the generated report is subjected to a strict automated audit. The Gemini API re-examines the report against the original source texts to flag critical issues like:
Hallucination: Factual statements not supported by any source text.
Incorrect Attribution: Citing the wrong LLM provider for a claim.
Missing or Incorrect Citations.
Step 6: Verified Claims Compilation: The application presents a final, clean list of all claims, separating them into "High-Consensus" and "Disputed" categories. This allows users to easily identify the most reliable information and the areas that require further scrutiny.
Step 7: Executive Summary Generation: For quick insights, a concise, high-level executive summary of the findings is generated.
Step 8: Analysis Dashboard: The final output is a visual dashboard of pie charts that quantify the quality of the synthesized research, showing breakdowns of claims by citation status, source verification, and overall consensus level.
3. Strict Provenance and Transparency
This is the application's cornerstone feature.
Inline Citations: Every factual statement in the final report is followed by a numerical citation (e.g., [1]) and the name of the source LLM provider (e.g., (GEMINI)).
Clickable Sources: Citations are hyperlinked, allowing the user to click through directly to the source URL.
Flagging Uncited Claims: Any claim originating from a source that lacked its own citation is explicitly highlighted in the report, making evidence gaps transparent.
4. User Experience (UX)
Interactive Pipeline: The UI is built around a series of clear, interactive "Step Cards" that guide the user through the process, displaying the status and results of each stage.
API Key Integration: The application securely integrates with Google AI Studio's API key management, prompting the user to select a key before starting.
Modern Interface: The application features a clean, professional, dark-themed design that is both aesthetic and functional, allowing for clear presentation of complex data.
