# Training Data for PROMPT ML

This directory contains sample research file sets for training the self-improving prompt system.

## Structure

```
training/
├── sample-set-1/    # Your first research file set
├── sample-set-2/    # Your second research file set
├── sample-set-3/    # Your third research file set
└── README.md
```

## How to Use

1. Place your research files (`.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, etc.) in each sample-set folder
2. Run the training script (to be created)
3. The system will generate content using each variant and learn from the results

## File Format

Each sample set should contain research files that you would normally upload to generate a Gantt chart. The training script will use these to simulate real generations.
