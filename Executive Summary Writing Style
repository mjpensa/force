# Executive Summary Generator - Adaptive Narrative System

## Philosophy

Every research document contains a unique story. The goal is not to force research into a template—it's to discover the narrative that naturally emerges from the evidence. Each executive summary should feel fresh, distinct, and authentic to its source material.

**The Old Way:** "Fill these 7 sections with these exact word counts"
**The New Way:** "Find the story in the research and tell it compellingly"

## Core Principles

### 1. Source Fidelity (Non-Negotiable)

Every assertion must trace directly to the provided research. No exceptions.

| Claim Type | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| Statistics | Must appear verbatim in research |
| Company/Project names | Must be mentioned in research |
| Causal claims ("X causes Y") | Must have research support |
| Projections/Forecasts | Must cite the source making that projection |
| Dates/Deadlines | Must be stated in research |

**Citation Format:** Place [source] immediately after each claim, inline.

**When Research Conflicts:** Acknowledge it—"While [Source A] reports X, [Source B] indicates Y..."

**When Research Is Limited:** Use only what's available. A focused 1,200-word analysis of what IS known beats an 1,800-word analysis that invents information.

### 2. Adaptive Structure

The structure should emerge from the research, not be imposed upon it.

**Before writing, assess:**
- What is the richest area of evidence? (Lead with strength)
- What statistics are most surprising?
- What specific examples are named?
- Is there tension, transformation, urgency, or a hidden story?

### 3. Narrative Variety

Each summary should feel like a new story, not a filled-in template.

## Step 1: Analyze the Research Profile

### Data Characteristics
- What data is richest?
- Where are the gaps?
- What's most surprising or significant?
- What companies, projects, events are named?

### Narrative Signals
- **TENSION/CONFLICT:** Competing forces, paradoxes, winners/losers
- **TRANSFORMATION:** Before/after, old way/new way
- **URGENCY:** Deadlines, windows closing, tipping points
- **HIDDEN STORY:** Surface vs. reality, counterintuitive findings

### Stakeholder Landscape
- Who is most affected?
- Are there clear winners and losers?
- What decisions do they face?

## Step 2: Choose Your Narrative Approach

### Opening Strategies (Choose ONE)

| Strategy | Best When | Pattern |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **The Paradox** | Research shows capability vs. reality gap | "The technology exists to [X]—yet [contradictory reality]..." |
| **The Moment** | Research contains pivotal dates/milestones | "In [month/year], [specific event] marked a turning point..." |
| **The Number** | One statistic crystallizes everything | "[Shocking statistic]. That single figure encapsulates..." |
| **The Question** | Competing forces on collision course | "What happens when [force A] collides with [force B]?" |
| **The Stakes** | Research quantifies impact/risk | "[$X billion / Y million people] will be affected by..." |

### Structure Patterns (Choose ONE)

**The Transformation Arc** - For clear before/after narratives
1. The Current State (what's broken, with evidence)
2. The Forces of Change (what's driving transformation)
3. The New Reality (what's emerging)
4. The Path Forward (what stakeholders must do)

**The Collision Course** - For competing forces narratives
1. Force A (described with evidence)
2. Force B (described with evidence)
3. The Collision Point (where they meet)
4. Winners, Losers, Survivors

**The Hidden Story** - For counterintuitive findings
1. The Surface Reality (what most people think)
2. The Evidence (what research actually shows)
3. The Real Story (the counterintuitive truth)
4. The Implications (why this matters)

**The Countdown** - For deadline-driven narratives
1. The Deadline (specific date/timeframe)
2. What's at Stake (quantified consequences)
3. Who's Ready (with evidence)
4. Who's Not (with evidence)
5. The Reckoning

### Closing Strategies (Choose ONE)

| Strategy | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| **The Callback** | Reference and evolve your opening |
| **The Choice** | Frame the binary decision with clear stakes |
| **The Prediction** | Bold, sourced forecast |
| **The Question** | Leave them with what matters most |
| **The Imperative** | Direct call to action |

## Step 3: Craft Branded Concepts

Create 3-5 memorable concepts that **emerge organically** from the research.

### Good Branded Concepts:
- Capture a real phenomenon in the research
- Are memorable and quotable
- Can be used consistently throughout

### Bad Branded Concepts:
- Generic templates filled in mechanically
- Don't map to anything specific in the research
- Sound impressive but mean nothing

### Concept Creation Approaches:
- **Name the problem:** "The [specific dysfunction]"
- **Name the disruptor:** "The [actor] [what they do]"
- **Name the phenomenon:** What would you call this explaining to a colleague?
- **Name the choice:** "The [stakeholder] [dilemma/pivot/imperative]"

**Quality over quantity.** Three concepts that resonate beat seven that feel manufactured.

## Step 4: Write with These Principles

### Length Guidelines (Adaptive)

| Research Density | Word Count | Approach |
|-----------------|------------|----------|
| Rich (many data points, multiple sources) | 1,600-2,000 | Full narrative treatment |
| Moderate | 1,200-1,600 | Focused analysis |
| Sparse | 800-1,200 | Acknowledge limitations |

**The right length is whatever fully tells the story without padding.**

### Section Weighting (Flexible)

Spend words where the research is strongest:
- Opening/Setup: ~10-15%
- Main Evidence Sections: ~50-60%
- Implications/Strategy: ~20-25%
- Conclusion: ~5-10%

### Language Principles

**Precision over drama:**
- "47% of transactions" not "nearly half"
- Exact figures, never rounded for effect
- Specific names, not "major players"

**Evidence-first sentences:**
- Lead with data, then interpret
- "[Statistic] [citation]. This reveals..."
- NOT: "Dramatically, the industry is transforming..."

**Earned drama:**
- Dramatic language is earned by dramatic evidence
- 2,727% increase → "explosive growth" ✓
- 12% increase → "revolutionary" ✗

**Confident uncertainty:**
- Be confident about what research DOES show
- Be honest about what it DOESN'T show
- "The research demonstrates X, though [acknowledged gap]"

### Metaphor Discipline

If using metaphors, maintain ONE system throughout:
- **Infrastructure:** bridges, rails, highways, corridors
- **Military:** fortress, battles, campaigns, fronts
- **Geological:** tectonic, fault lines, shifts, erosion
- **Biological:** evolution, ecosystem, adaptation

Or create your own if research suggests something more authentic.

**One system, used consistently.** Mixing metaphors undermines credibility.

## Quality Tests (Must Pass All)

### The Source Test
"Can I point to the exact place in the research that supports this claim?"
- If NO → Remove or flag as inference

### The CEO Test
"Would a busy executive find this worth their time?"
- If NO → Increase stakes, sharpen insights, cut filler

### The Fresh Test
"Does this feel like a unique story, or a template with blanks filled in?"
- If TEMPLATE → Rethink structure, let research guide you

### The Action Test
"Does the reader know what to DO after reading?"
- If NO → Sharpen strategic implications

### The Memory Test
"Will the reader remember 2-3 key concepts tomorrow?"
- If NO → Strengthen branded concepts

---

## Output Format

### Formatting Rules
- Level 1 headings: Major sections with branded titles (not "Part I")
- Level 2 headings: Subsections
- Primarily flowing paragraphs—lists only when they aid comprehension
- Bold for key terms and initiative names

### Title Format
Create a compelling title that captures YOUR narrative:
- Can follow "The [Concept]: [Subtitle]" pattern
- Or another format if it better fits the story
- Must signal what reader will learn and why it matters

## Summary: The Adaptive Process

```
1. ANALYZE research → Identify data density, narrative signals, stakeholders
2. CHOOSE approach → Opening strategy, structure pattern, closing technique
3. DISCOVER concepts → Let branded ideas emerge from evidence
4. WRITE adaptively → Scale length to research, lead with strength
5. VERIFY sources → Every claim must trace to research
6. TEST quality → Source, CEO, Fresh, Action, Memory tests
```

The goal: Each summary feels like discovering a unique story, not filling in a familiar template.
